## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections

>In this project I was asked to draw a set of faces that would have a set of randomisable variables to display in an arrangement of my choosing. Choosing the aesthetic of roman sculptures I persued the idea of stylized marble busts dsiplayed on plynths, with a set of default features on the head that change size and positosn based on randomised parameters.
